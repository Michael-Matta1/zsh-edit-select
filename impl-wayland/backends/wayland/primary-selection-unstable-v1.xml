        To transfer the offered data, the client issues this request and
        indicates the mime type it wants to receive. The transfer happens
        through the passed file descriptor (typically created with the
        pipe system call). The source client writes the data in the mime
        type representation requested and then closes the file descriptor.

        The receiving client reads from the read end of the pipe until
        EOF and then closes its end, at which point the transfer is
        complete.
